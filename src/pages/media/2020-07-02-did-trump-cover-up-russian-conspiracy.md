American intelligence officials have concluded that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for targeting American troops. The New York Times reported it on 26 June, citing their sources within the administration. According to these sources, twenty Americans were killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2019, and the intelligence findings were presented to President Donald Trump and the White Houseâ€™s National Security Council in late March. Donald Trump, in turn, said that he was not informed about anything like this, and Moscow and the Taliban have denied their involvement.
