Humility is in shorter supply than surgical masks these days. The American Christian faith, once a bastion of humility, has gone all muscular. The servant leader concept, popular in the American business community for decades, has been replaced with the Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun. After the 9/11 attacks, there was a brief bout of national humility before we got on with the business of making the world over through brute force, then sullenly withdrawing when it didn’t go well. We are all masters of the universe now, and when the universe doesn’t bend our way, we embrace blame, not introspection.
