The crisis in Venezuela has moved from an internal tragedy to a threat to regional peace and security, with increasing political breakdown, growing COVID-19 infection, and disarray in its internal fuel market. Its hungry and battered people are the victims. The country is in line to become the first failed state in the Americas without a functioning economy or government, with warring factions carving up territory. Negotiations have so far failed. Only a fundamental change in strategy can deal with the crisis â€“ and the United Nations should take the lead in shaping a humanitarian political truce to carry out a massive relief effort, while negotiating the terms of fair elections.
