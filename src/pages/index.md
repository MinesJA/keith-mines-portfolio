  title: About
  description: >
   In thirty two years of diplomatic and military service I have worked on counter-insurgency in Central America, Middle East peace in Israel and the West Bank, post-conflict stabilization in Haiti, Iraq, and Afghanistan, global financial stability and the environment with Brazil, NATO expansion in Hungary, counter-narcotics as the first Merida Initiative Director in Mexico City, and famine relief in Darfur and Somalia. I have a proven track record as a unifying, creative leader who can solve complex problems. Internationally I seek the opportunity to continue to serve in challenging assignments that require strong teamwork and new thinking. Domestically, I seek to actively apply what I have learned about social cohesion and political consolidation to help mend the disquieting divisions in the United States. Author of Why Nation Building Matters (due out in August 2020), engaging speaker, creative thinker.
